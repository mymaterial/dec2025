ACID Properties
------------------
1. SQL

2. ACID

	Atomicity
	
		- irrespective of no.of statements in your transaction, treat it as single.
		- PG achieves this with the help of transaction blocks (begin/end)
	begin;
	update emp set sal=sal-200 where id=1; 
	update emp set sal=sal+200 where id=2;
	end;
	
	Consistency
	
	- Before/After your transaction., your db should be const.
	
	Isolation
	
	- Reads and Writes should not interfere each other / Reads should see const. past image
	- MVCC
	- Oracle achieves it with concept of Undo tablespace
	
	
	Durability
	
	- at any cost my data should be safe.
	- WAL/Transaction logs 
	- Oracle achieves it with concept of Redo logs
